# FullStackOpen Course Repository

This repository contains my solutions and projects for the [FullStackOpen course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/). This course is an in-depth learning resource that covers modern web development, including both front-end and back-end technologies.

## Course Overview

The FullStackOpen course is divided into several parts, each focusing on different aspects of full-stack development. The course covers various topics, including:

- JavaScript
- React
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB
- GraphQL
- TypeScript
- React Native
- CI/CD
- Containers
- Testing
- Deployment

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into different directories, each corresponding to a specific part or module of the course. Here's an overview of the directory structure:
```
├── part0
├── part1
|   ├── courseinfo
│   ├── unicafe
│   └── anecdotes
└── part2
    ├── courseinfo
    ├── phonebook
    └── countries
```

Each part directory contains the relevant exercises, projects, and their corresponding solutions. This course currently contains 13 parts, so this repository will be updated according to my progess on the course.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to extend my gratitude to the creators of the FullStackOpen course for providing such a comprehensive and valuable resource for learning full-stack development.
